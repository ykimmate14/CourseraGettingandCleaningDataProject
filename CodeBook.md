device| Two devices used to make measurements (accelerometer or gyroscope)
domainSignal| Two possible domain signal (time or frequency)
accFeat| Acceleration signal (Body or Gravity)
jerkFeat| Jerk signal
magFeat| Magnitude of signal
axis| 3 axial measurements in x, y, z direction.
var| Variable (mean or std)
value| Avg value of each variable for each activity and each subject
